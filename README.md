| **[ChronoGraph: A Real-World Graph-Based Multivariate Time Series Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose a method to forecast future increments of the LFSM from past discrete-time observations, using the conditional expectation when $α>1$ or a semimetric projection otherwise. It relies on the codifference, which describes the serial dependence of the process, instead of the covariance. Indeed, covariance is commonly used for predicting an fBm but it is infinite when $α<2$. Some theoretical properties of the method and of its accuracy are studied and both a simulation study and an application to real data confirm the relevance of the approach. The LFSM-based method outperforms the fBm, when forecasting high-frequency FX rates. It also shows a promising performance in the forecast of time series of volatilities, decomposing properly, in the fractal dynamic of rough volatilities, the contribution of the kurtosis of the increments and the contribution of their serial dependence. Moreover, the analysis of hit ratios suggests that, beside independence, persistence, and antipersistence, a fourth regime of serial dependence exists for fractional processes, characterized by a selective memory controlled by a few large increments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.</p></details> |  |
| **[RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08229v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions. All codes are available at https://github.com/PandaJunk/DTAF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[MDMLP-EIA: Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09924v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaReTS: A Multi-Task Framework Unifying Classification and Regression for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09789v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[xLSTMAD: A Powerful xLSTM-based Method for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22837v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Nyderx/xlstmad</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Interaction Autoregressive Model for High Dimension Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09542v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional matrix and tensor time series often exhibit local dependency, where each entry interacts mainly with a small neighborhood. Accounting for local interactions in a prediction model can greatly reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space, leading to more efficient inference and more accurate predictions. We propose a Local Interaction Autoregressive (LIAR) framework and study Separable LIAR, a variant with shared row and column components, for high-dimensional matrix/tensor time series forecasting problems. We derive a scalable parameter estimation algorithm via parallel least squares with a BIC-type neighborhood selector. Theoretically, we show consistency of neighborhood selection and derive error bounds for kernel and auto-covariance estimation. Numerical simulations show that the BIC selector recovers the true neighborhood with high success rates, the LIAR achieves small estimation errors, and the forecasts outperform matrix time-series baselines. In real data applications, a Total Electron Content (TEC) case study shows the model can identify localized spatio-temporal propagation and improved prediction as compared with non-local time series prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Chi-Square Method beats Discrete Fourier Transform and other similar parametric time series analysis methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational statistical well-posed solution for this problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple time series analysis method computes a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We use the Fisher-test to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. This best model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of simulated complex data sets expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DFT and DCM are frequency-domain parametric methods. There are many other similar parametric methods. Just like DFT, those other methods suffer from their own particular application limitations. The list of those limitations is long. DCM suffers from none of those limitations. The performance of DCM depends only on the data set size and accuracy. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the data set time span $(ΔT)$ is irrelevant. It does not matter how long $(ΔT)$ and/or complex the data set is because DCM will inevitably detect the signal(-s) and the trend when the data set size $(n)$ and/or accuracy $(σ)$ become adequate.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v6)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[STOAT: Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09544v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repetitive Contrastive Learning Enhances Mamba's Selectivity in Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09185v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[rfBLT: Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens Model for time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08957v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series prediction is challenging due to our limited understanding of the underlying dynamics. Conventional models such as ARIMA and Holt's linear trend model experience difficulty in identifying nonlinear patterns in time series. In contrast, machine learning models excel at learning complex patterns and handling high-dimensional data; however, they are unable to quantify the uncertainty associated with their predictions, as statistical models do. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens (rfBLT) for forecasting time series data. This non-parametric model captures the underlying system via the Takens' theorem and measures the degree of uncertainty with credible intervals. This is achieved by projecting delay embeddings into a higher-dimensional space via random features and applying regularization within the Bayesian framework to identify relevant terms. Our results demonstrate that the rfBLT method is comparable to traditional statistical models on simulated data, while significantly outperforming both conventional and machine learning models when evaluated on real-world data. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an R package, rfBLT.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaCast: A Human Wisdom-LLM Intelligence Co-Reasoning Framework for Interactive Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08947v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/SkyeGT/AlphaCast_Official .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Theoretical Analysis of Detecting Large Model-Generated Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07104v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages,12 figures, to be published in AAAI-2026 main track</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Predictability as a Fast Reliability Indicator for Time Series Forecasting Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08884v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMAformer: Enhancing Transformer through Embedding Armor for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08396v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across a wide range of domains. While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting.

| **[HN-MVTS: HyperNetwork-based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08340v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

The particular area of interest of this research is to examine the correlation of these indexes' behaviour in terms of Machine Learning algorithms cross-training. Would training an algorithm on an index from one global market produce similar or even better accuracy when such a model is applied for predicting another index from a different market? The demonstrated predominately positive answer to this question is another argument in favour of the long-debated Efficient Market Hypothesis of Eugene Fama.</p></details> |  |
| **[CometNet: Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08049v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term Time Series Forecasting is crucial across numerous critical domains, yet its accuracy remains fundamentally constrained by the receptive field bottleneck in existing models. Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted at the AAAI2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406v4)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI</p></details> |
| **[A Realistic Evaluation of Cross-Frequency Transfer Learning and Foundation Forecasting Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19465v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Thirt...</summary><p>Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems {NeurIPS 2025}.

| **[The Few Govern the Many:Unveiling Few-Layer Dominance for Time Series Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07237v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02198v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional financial time series often exhibit complex dependence relations driven by both common market structures and latent connections among assets. To capture these characteristics, this paper proposes Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (FNIRVAR), a model for the common and idiosyncratic components of high-dimensional time series with an underlying unobserved network structure. The common component is modelled by a static factor model, which allows for strong cross-sectional dependence, whilst a network vector autoregressive process captures the residual co-movements due to the idiosyncratic component. An assortative stochastic block model underlies the network VAR, leading to groups of highly co-moving variables in the idiosyncratic component. For estimation, a two-step procedure is proposed, whereby the static factors are estimated via principal component analysis, followed by estimation of the network VAR parameters. The method is demonstrated in financial applications to daily returns, intraday returns, and FRED-MD macroeconomic variables. In all cases, the proposed method outperforms a static factor model, as well as a static factor plus LASSO-estimated sparse VAR model, in terms of forecasting and financial performance metrics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper, we propose Diffolio, a diffusion model designed for multivariate financial time-series forecasting and portfolio construction. Diffolio employs a denoising network with a hierarchical attention architecture, comprising both asset-level and market-level layers. Furthermore, to better reflect cross-sectional correlations, we introduce a correlation-guided regularizer informed by a stable estimate of the target correlation matrix. This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio. These results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Diffolio in terms of not only statistical accuracy but also economic significance.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting, but this progress is still met with skepticism about whether LLMs are truly useful for this task. To address this, we propose Time-Prompt, a framework for activating LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, we first construct a unified prompt paradigm with learnable soft prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and textualized hard prompts to enhance the time series representations. Second, to enhance LLM' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve fusion of temporal and textual data. Finally, we efficiently fine-tune the LLM's parameters using time series data. Furthermore, we focus on carbon emissions, aiming to provide a modest contribution to global carbon neutrality. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that Time-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>27pag...</summary><p>27pages,9figures,9tables</p></details> |

Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages,17 pages, Published in AAAI-26</p></details> |

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Journal of Forecasting</p></details> |
| **[A Weak Penalty Neural ODE for Learning Chaotic Dynamics from Noisy Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06609v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Effective Random Forest Modelling for Nonlinear Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06544v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Random Forests by Random Weights (RF-RW), a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative RF modelling for nonlinear time series data, where existing RF-based approaches struggle to adequately capture temporal dependence. RF-RW reconciles the strengths of classic RF with the temporal dependence inherent in time series forecasting. Specifically, it avoids the bootstrap resampling procedure, therefore preserves the serial dependence structure, whilst incorporates independent random weights to reduce correlations among trees. We establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds and asymptotic uniform consistency guarantees, for both fixed- and high-dimensional feature spaces, which extend beyond existing theoretical analyses of RF. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that RF-RW outperforms existing RF-based approaches and other benchmarks such as SVM and LSTM. It also achieves the lowest error among competitors in our real-data example of predicting UK COVID-19 daily cases.</p></details> |  |

We propose Forecasting Counterfactuals under Stochastic Dynamics (FOCUS), a method that extends traditional matrix completion methods by leveraging time series dynamics of the factors, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of future counterfactuals. Building upon a PCA estimator, our method accommodates both stochastic and deterministic components within the factors, and provides a flexible framework for various applications. In case of stationary autoregressive factors and under standard conditions, we derive error bounds and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks when the latent factors have an autoregressive component. We illustrate FOCUS results on HeartSteps, a mobile health study, illustrating its effectiveness in forecasting step counts for users receiving activity prompts, thereby leveraging temporal patterns in user behavior.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |
| **[LiteCast: A Lightweight Forecaster for Carbon Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06187v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over recent decades, electricity demand has experienced sustained growth through widespread electrification of transportation and the accelerated expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a proceedings paper at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2025, December 1-2, 2025, San Diego, United States, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Two-stage hybrid models for enhancing forecasting accuracy on heterogeneous time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08600v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series forecasting model--which is typically built on a single time series--is known as a local time series model (tsLM). In contrast, a forecasting model trained on multiple time series is referred to as a global time series model (tsGM). tsGMs can enhance forecasting accuracy and improve generalisation by learning cross-series information. As such, developing tsGMs has become a prominent research focus within the time series forecasting community. However, the benefits of tsGMs may not always be realised if the given set of time series is heterogeneous. While increasing model complexity can help tsGMs adapt to such a set of data, it can also increase the risk of overfitting and forecasting error. Additionally, the definition of homogeneity remains ambiguous in the literature. To address these challenges, this paper explores how to define data heterogeneity and proposes a two-stage modelling framework: At stage one, a tsGM is learnt to identify homogeneous patterns; and at stage two, tsLMs (e.g., ARIMA) or sub-tsGMs tailored to different groups are learnt to capture the heterogeneity. Numerical experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art models. These results highlight its effectiveness in unlocking the full potential of global forecasting models for heterogeneous datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability.

However, it remains challenging due to structural breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches, have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.</p></details> |  |

We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality. A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning on Time-Series for Financial Technical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08616v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAIF...</summary><p>ICAIF 2025 Workshop (Best Paper)</p></details> |
| **[ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04445v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components; a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Porti...</summary><p>Portions of this work were previously published in the author's Master's thesis at University of Windsor (2024)</p></details> |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |
| **[AWEMixer: Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04722v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence time series forecasting.

However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community, largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF, here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance), e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views -> messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its systematic exploration in social and usage data.

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making.

However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[Efficient Linear Attention for Multivariate Time Series Modeling via Entropy Equality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03190v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications, including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast2Anomaly (F2A): Adapting Multivariate Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03149v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast, pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly (F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates. By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction. Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We conduct preliminary studies towards the development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date information) for a single day.

These tasks are typically modeled in an autoregressive fashion, where each token is generated conditional on the preceding ones, and beam search is commonly used to balance exploration and fluency during decoding. While deep learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing statistical patterns in this setting, they remain ill-equipped to guarantee compliance with formal constraints. In this paper, we introduce ABS: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with any constraint that can be compiled into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), without requiring retraining. ABS leverages the DFA to guide a constrained variant of beam search: at each decoding step, transitions leading to violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked according to both the model's probabilities and the automaton's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that ABS also improves output quality. We validate our approach on three distinct tasks: constrained image-stream classification, controlled text generation, and text infilling. In all settings, ABS achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art baselines on standard quality metrics and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent connectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel transformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed phase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides a principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed coordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the reservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters such as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on canonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor reconstructions and long-horizon forecasts. These results show that the combination of delay embedding and RFF-based reservoirs reveals new dynamical structure by embedding the system in an enriched feature space, providing a computationally efficient and interpretable approach to modeling chaotic dynamics.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Benchmark for GNSS-based Precipitation Nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation Nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like precipitation nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for precipitation nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focusing on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at hourly intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 140 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation protocols to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, including multi-scale prediction, multi-resolution forecasting, and extreme rainfall events, benchmarking 17 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> | 13 pages,11 figures |

DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. ProbHardE2E optimizes a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general framework that connects these seemingly disparate domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

We present DoFlow, a flow based generative model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions. Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual queries, and effectively detects anomalies.

| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates.

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

At inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the streamlined integration of time series with textual information.

| **[Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks for Epileptic Seizure Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01275v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting epileptic seizures from multivariate EEG signals represents a critical challenge in healthcare time series prediction, requiring high sensitivity, low false alarm rates, and subject-specific adaptability. We present STAN, an Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Network that jointly models spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics through cascaded attention blocks with alternating spatial and temporal modules. Unlike existing approaches that assume fixed preictal durations or separately process spatial and temporal features, STAN captures bidirectional dependencies between spatial and temporal patterns through a unified cascaded architecture. Adversarial training with gradient penalty enables robust discrimination between interictal and preictal states learned from clearly defined 15-minute preictal windows. Continuous 90-minute pre-seizure monitoring reveals that the learned spatio-temporal attention patterns enable early detection: reliable alarms trigger at subject-specific times (typically 15-45 minutes before onset), reflecting the model's capacity to capture subtle preictal dynamics without requiring individualized training. Experiments on two benchmark EEG datasets (CHB-MIT scalp: 8 subjects, 46 events; MSSM intracranial: 4 subjects, 14 events) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: 96.6% sensitivity with 0.011 false detections per hour and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063 false detections per hour, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency (2.3M parameters, 45 ms latency, 180 MB memory) for real-time edge deployment. Beyond epilepsy, the proposed framework provides a general paradigm for spatio-temporal forecasting in healthcare and other time series domains where individual heterogeneity and interpretability are crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Understanding how key events shape SMs is key to the achievement of the SDGs. We have developed SMART (Social Media Analysis & Reasoning Tool) to track social movements related to the SDGs. SMART was designed by a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers, journalists, communications scholars and legal experts. This paper describes SMART's transformer-based multivariate time series Discourse Evolution Engine for Predictions about Social Movements (DEEP) to predict the volume of future articles/posts and the emotions expressed. DEEP outputs probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty estimates, providing critical support for editorial planning and strategic decision-making. We evaluate DEEP with a case study of the #MeToo movement by creating a novel longitudinal dataset (433K Reddit posts and 121K news articles) from September 2024 to June 2025 that will be publicly released for research purposes upon publication of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IAAI 2026.

Standard Dirichlet time series models assume constant precision and therefore miss these episodes. We introduce B-DARMA-DARCH, a Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average model with a Dirichlet ARCH component, which lets the precision parameter follow an ARMA recursion. The specification preserves the Dirichlet likelihood so forecasts remain valid compositions while capturing clustered volatility. Simulations and out-of-sample tests show that B-DARMA-DARCH lowers forecast error and improves interval calibration relative to Dirichlet ARMA and log-ratio VARMA benchmarks, providing a concise framework for settings where both the level and the volatility of proportions matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23719v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Transformers, MLPs, and linear models as the de facto backbones of modern time series models have shown promising results in single-variant and/or short-term forecasting. These models, however: (1) are permutation equivariant and so lack temporal inductive bias, being less expressive to capture the temporal dynamics; (2) are naturally designed for univariate setup, missing the inter-dependencies of temporal and variate dimensions; and/or (3) are inefficient for Long-term time series modeling. To overcome training and inference efficiency as well as the lack of temporal inductive bias, recently, linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have gained attention as an alternative to Transformer-based models. These models, however, are inherently limited to a single sequence, missing inter-variate dependencies, and can propagate errors due to their additive nature. In this paper, we present Hydra, a by-design two-headed meta in-context memory module that learns how to memorize patterns at test time by prioritizing time series patterns that are more informative about the data. Hydra uses a 2-dimensional recurrence across both time and variate at each step, which is more powerful than mixing methods. Although the 2-dimensional nature of the model makes its training recurrent and non-parallelizable, we present a new 2D-chunk-wise training algorithm that approximates the actual recurrence with $\times 10$ efficiency improvement, while maintaining the effectiveness. Our experimental results on a diverse set of tasks and datasets, including time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection show the superior performance of Hydra compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SST: Multi-Scale Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Experts for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14757v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has made significant advances, including with Transformer-based models. The attention mechanism in Transformer effectively captures temporal dependencies by attending to all past inputs simultaneously. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length limits the scalability for long-range modeling. Recent state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative by achieving linear complexity without attention. Yet, Mamba compresses historical information into a fixed-size latent state, potentially causing information loss and limiting representational effectiveness. This raises a key research question: Can we design a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture that is both effective and efficient for time series forecasting? To address it, we adapt a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture Mambaformer, originally proposed for language modeling, to the time series domain. Preliminary experiments reveal that naively stacking Mamba and Transformer layers in Mambaformer is suboptimal for time series forecasting, due to an information interference problem. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new time series decomposition strategy that separates time series into long-range patterns and short-range variations. Then we show that Mamba excels at capturing long-term structures, while Transformer is more effective at modeling short-term dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose State Space Transformer (SST), a multi-scale hybrid model with expert modules: a Mamba expert for long-range patterns and a Transformer expert for short-term variations. SST also employs a multi-scale patching mechanism to adaptively adjust time series resolution: low resolution for long-term patterns and high resolution for short-term variations. Experiments show that SST obtains SOTA performance with linear scalability. The code is at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/SST.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |

However, traditional lead-lag detection methods are limited by their reliance on statistical analysis methods and by the assumption of persistent lead-lag patterns, which are often invalid in dynamic market conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{DeltaLag}, the first end-to-end deep learning method that discovers and exploits dynamic lead-lag structures with pair-specific lag values in financial markets for portfolio construction. Specifically, DeltaLag employs a sparsified cross-attention mechanism to identify relevant lead-lag pairs. These lead-lag signals are then leveraged to extract lag-aligned raw features from the leading stocks for predicting the lagger stock's future return. Empirical evaluations show that DeltaLag substantially outperforms both fixed-lag and self-lead-lag baselines. In addition, its adaptive mechanism for identifying lead-lag relationships consistently surpasses precomputed lead-lag graphs based on statistical methods. Furthermore, DeltaLag outperforms a wide range of temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning models designed for stock prediction or time series forecasting, offering both better trading performance and enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |

It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.

| **[Reducing Robotic Upper-Limb Assessment Time While Maintaining Precision: A Time Series Foundation Model Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00193v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Visually Guided Reaching (VGR) on the Kinarm robot yields sensitive kinematic biomarkers but requires 40-64 reaches, imposing time and fatigue burdens. We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace unrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the reliability of standard Kinarm parameters. Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control participants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the first 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models, fine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We recomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time, posture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and compared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1). Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only 8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded reaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA improvements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials replaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability. Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR assessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5 minutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This forecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for assessing motor impairments following stroke.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

In the standard Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (B-DARMA) recursion, this MA regressor has a nonzero conditional mean under the Dirichlet likelihood, which biases the mean path and complicates interpretation of the MA coefficients. We propose a minimal change: replace the raw regressor with a centered innovation equal to the ALR residual minus its conditional expectation, computable in closed form using digamma functions. Centering restores mean-zero innovations for the MA block without altering either the likelihood or the ALR link. We provide closed-form identities for the conditional mean and forecast recursion, show first-order equivalence to a digamma-link DARMA while retaining a simple inverse back to the mean composition, and supply ready-to-use code. In a weekly application to the Federal Reserve H.8 bank-asset composition, the centered specification improves log predictive scores with virtually identical point accuracy and markedly cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling US Climate Policy Uncertainty: From Causal Identification to Probabilistic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12276v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is critical for designing effective climate strategies that balance economic growth with environmental objectives. Elevated CPU levels deter investment in green technologies, delay regulatory implementation, and amplify public resistance to policy reforms, particularly during economic stress. Despite the growing literature highlighting the economic relevance of CPU, the mechanisms through which macroeconomic and financial conditions influence its fluctuations remain insufficiently explored. This study addresses this gap by integrating four complementary causal inference techniques to identify statistically and economically significant determinants of the United States (US) CPU index. Impulse response analysis confirms their dynamic effects on CPU, highlighting the role of housing market activity, credit conditions, and financial market sentiment in shaping CPU fluctuations. The identified predictors, along with sentiment based Google Trends indicators, are incorporated into a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) framework for probabilistic forecasting. The inclusion of Google Trends data captures behavioral and attention based dynamics, leading to notable improvements in forecast accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of BSTS over state of the art classical and modern architectures for medium and long term forecasts, which are most relevant for climate policy implementation. The feature importance plot provides evidence that the spike-and-slab prior mechanism provides interpretable variable selection. The credible intervals quantify forecast uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's transparency and policy relevance by enabling strategic decision making.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on a new problem of source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.</p></details> |  |

However, given their energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF -- and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets, SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training and inference in low-resource settings.</p></details> |  |

These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LVM-based forecaster poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast-residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 SOTA models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.

Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance.

CSAI extends state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation by introducing key modifications specific to EHR data: a) attention-based hidden state initialisation to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) domain-informed temporal decay to mimic clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrates CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art architectures in data restoration and downstream tasks. CSAI is integrated into PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</p></details> |  |

However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted at the AAAI2025 conference</p></details> |

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

Recently, two such models, TabPFN-TS and MoTM, have emerged. These models share a common philosophy that places them within the family of time-indexed foundation models. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of these models for zero-shot imputation, which enables missing value recovery without retraining across a wide range of scenarios. We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that time-indexed foundation models are a powerful and practical step toward achieving general-purpose, zero-shot imputation for real-world time series.</p></details> |  |

However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our UIST'25 paper "HAGI: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation for Mobile Eye Trackers"</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interdisciplinary and Cross-Task Review on Missing Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01196v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data is a fundamental challenge in data science, significantly hindering analysis and decision-making across a wide range of disciplines, including healthcare, bioinformatics, social science, e-commerce, and industrial monitoring. Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing Gaps: An Imputation Analysis of ICU Vital Signs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24217v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate, contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods, created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models into clinical practice.</p></details> | Preprint |

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Task-Aware Time Series Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22279v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Besov Priors for Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16378v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast development in science and technology has driven the need for proper statistical tools to capture special data features such as abrupt changes or sharp contrast. Many inverse problems in data science require spatiotemporal solutions derived from a sequence of time-dependent objects with these spatial features, e.g., the dynamic reconstruction of computerized tomography (CT) images with edges. Conventional methods based on Gaussian processes (GP) often fall short in providing satisfactory solutions since they tend to offer oversmooth priors. Recently, the Besov process (BP), defined by wavelet expansions with random coefficients, has emerged as a more suitable prior for Bayesian inverse problems of this nature. While BP excels in handling spatial inhomogeneity, it does not automatically incorporate temporal correlation inherited in the dynamically changing objects. In this paper, we generalize BP to a novel spatiotemporal Besov process (STBP) by replacing the random coefficients in the series expansion with stochastic time functions as Q-exponential process (Q-EP) which governs the temporal correlation structure. We thoroughly investigate the mathematical and statistical properties of STBP. Simulations, two limited-angle CT reconstruction examples, a highly non-linear inverse problem involving Navier-Stokes equation, and a spatiotemporal temperature imputation problem are used to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed STBP compared with the classic STGP and a time-uncorrelated approach.</p></details> | 64 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Extending Prediction-Powered Inference through Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16166v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction-powered inference is a recent methodology for the safe use of black-box ML models to impute missing data, strengthening inference of statistical parameters. However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[CauchyNet: Compact and Data-Efficient Learning using Holomorphic Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10195v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem, CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarbonX: An Open-Source Tool for Computational Decarbonization Using Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01521v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Corrected PDF rendering error on page 10 (caption of Figure 5 was previously overlapping with paper text)</p></details> |

Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection (CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points, combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper.

| **[Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04910v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.</p></details> |  |

Recently, diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures.

Most methods for imputation ignore label information pertaining to the time series even if that information exists. In this paper, we provide a framework for missing data imputation in the context of time series classification, where each time series is associated with a categorical label. We define a means of imputing missing values conditional upon labels, the method being guided by powerful, existing supervised models designed for high accuracy in this task. From each model, we extract a tree-based proximity measure from which imputation can be applied. We show that imputation using this method generally provides richer information leading to higher classification accuracies, despite the imputed values differing from the true values.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, one figure.

While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, these applications commonly face two critical challenges: time misalignment and data sparsity. Traditional approaches address these issues through a two-step process of imputation followed by prediction. We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components, MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.</p></details> | 36 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional imputation methods often fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and reduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a structure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant periodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data containing annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of noise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic real world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%). VBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies, which are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II multiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced approach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not incorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced imputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across all tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in high-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This study addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by offering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal structure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological implications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future directions for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figure and 3 tables</p></details> |

Diffusion models have shown to be effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Paper has been accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Coding Representation of 2-way Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10033v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand, dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution, called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent. We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality, AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for training.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis.

While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables.

We perform a series of experiments to derive novel insights about the performance of IMTS methods on a variety of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets for both classification and forecasting. We also introduce Missing Feature-aware Time Series Modeling (MissTSM) or MissTSM, a novel model-agnostic and imputation-free approach for IMTS modeling. We show that MissTSM shows competitive performance compared to other IMTS approaches, especially when the amount of missing values is large and the data lacks simplistic periodic structures - conditions common to real-world IMTS applications.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[pyFAST: A Modular PyTorch Framework for Time Series Modeling with Multi-source and Sparse Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18891v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient, and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading, protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting. pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time series research and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexTSF: A Flexible Forecasting Model for Time Series with Variable Regularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23160v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting time series with irregular temporal structures remains challenging for universal pre-trained models. Existing approaches often assume regular sampling or depend heavily on imputation, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where irregularities are prevalent due to diverse sensing devices and recording practices. We introduce FlexTSF, a flexible forecasting model specifically designed for time series data with variable temporal regularities. At its foundation lies the IVP Patcher, a continuous-time patching module leveraging Initial Value Problems (IVPs) to inherently support uneven time intervals, variable sequence lengths, and missing values. FlexTSF employs a decoder-only architecture that integrates normalized timestamp inputs and domain-specific statistics through a specialized causal self-attention mechanism, enabling adaptability across domains. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate FlexTSF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing models in classic forecasting scenarios, zero-shot generalization, and low-resource fine-tuning conditions. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each design component and the advantage of not relying on predefined fixed patch lengths.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30 benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

| **[Enhancing Transformer-Based Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Bagging, Boosting and Statistical Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos, MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons. Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for real-world time series applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11528v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: A Versatile Method for Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data can significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet they occur frequently in applications. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike most existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for empirical applications even with nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. Furthermore, our method mitigates the distributional bias common among many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. We establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering both linear and nonlinear time series and an analysis on a real-world groundwater dataset, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matrix Factorization-Based Solar Spectral Irradiance Missing Data Imputation with Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04074v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The solar spectral irradiance (SSI) depicts the spectral distribution of solar energy flux reaching the top of the Earth's atmosphere. The SSI data constitute a matrix with spectrally (rows) and temporally (columns) resolved solar energy flux measurements. The most recent SSI measurements have been made by NASA's Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) since March 2018. This data have considerable missing data due to both random factors and instrument downtime, a periodic trend related to the Sun's cyclical magnetic activity, and varying degrees of correlation among the spectra, some approaching unity. We propose a novel low-rank matrix factorization method that uses autoregressive regularization and periodic spline detrending to recover the missingness. The method is a two-step procedure, each of which tackles scattered and downtime missingness, respectively. We design efficient alternating algorithms to jointly estimate the model parameters. Moreover, we build a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method using conformal prediction. We validate the prediction interval coverage rates and assess the imputation accuracy against competing models such as Gaussian process regression and linear time series smoothing via numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Despite numerous imputation techniques, a systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series, multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 3 algorithms, 2 tables</p></details> |

Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

KZImputer employs a hybrid strategy to handle various missing data scenarios. Its core mechanism differentiates between gaps at the beginning, middle, or end of the series, applying tailored techniques at each position to optimize imputation accuracy. The method leverages linear interpolation and localized statistical measures, adapting to the characteristics of the surrounding data and the gap size. The performance of KZImputer has been systematically evaluated against established imputation techniques, demonstrating its potential to enhance data quality for subsequent time series analysis. This paper describes the KZImputer methodology in detail and discusses its effectiveness in improving the integrity of time series data. Empirical analysis demonstrates that KZImputer achieves particularly strong performance for datasets with high missingness rates (around 50% or more), maintaining stable and competitive results across statistical and signal-reconstruction metrics. The method proves especially effective in high-sparsity regimes, where traditional approaches typically experience accuracy degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/s-kav/kz_data_imputation</p></details> |

Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters (10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models.

However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was published in International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications (IJISA) (MECS Press), Vol. 17, No. 3, 8 Jun. 2025, DOI: https://doi.org/10.5815/ijisa.2025.03.05</p></details> |

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.

Continuous data collection through mobile devices generates highly complex data: entangled multivariate time series of outcomes, exposures, and covariates. Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex data structure of multivariate time series and their non-stationary nature make missing data a major challenge for proper inference. Additional historical information included in time series analyses exacerbates the issue of missing data and also introduces problems for confounding adjustment. The majority of existing imputation methods are either designed for stationary time series or for longitudinal data with limited follow-up periods. The limited work on non-stationary time series either focuses on missing exogenous information or ignores the complex temporal dependence among outcomes, exposures, and covariates. We propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for the state space model (MCEM-SSM) to effectively handle missing data in non-stationary entangled multivariate time series. We demonstrate the method's advantages over other widely used missing data imputation strategies through simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series, subject to various missing mechanisms. Finally, we apply the MCEM-SSM to a multi-year smartphone observational study of bipolar and schizophrenia patients to investigate the association between digital social connectivity and negative mood.</p></details> |  |
| **[PeakWeather: MeteoSwiss Weather Station Measurements for Spatiotemporal Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13652v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are essential for supporting a wide range of activities and decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the impacts of adverse weather events. While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Conditional Diffusion Models for Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12412v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Functions for Learning Periodic Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09526v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFMI: Flow Matching for Missing Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09258v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range of data types and dimensionalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.</p></details> |  |

With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

In this paper, a novel imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172 Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Why Large Language Models Can Be Ineffective in Time Series Analysis: The Impact of Modality Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12326v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in time series analysis and seems to understand the time temporal relationship well than traditional transformer-based approaches. However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display "pseudo-alignment" behavior in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing 863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand underestimation from 7.37% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code (https://github.com/Dingdong-Inc/frn-50k-baseline}) are openly released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The Alpha-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $α$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $α$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $α$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $α$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $α$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codebase will be made available upon publication.

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have successfully handled missing data by leveraging complex temporal dependencies and learned data distributions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive summary of deep learning approaches for multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) tasks. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on two key perspectives: imputation uncertainty and neural network architecture. Furthermore, we summarize existing MTSI toolkits with a particular emphasis on the PyPOTS Ecosystem, which provides an integrated and standardized foundation for MTSI research. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions, which give insight for further MTSI research.

| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v5)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeINR: Time Series Imputation via Implicit Neural Representations for Disease Diagnosis with Missing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10856v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare data frequently contain a substantial proportion of missing values, necessitating effective time series imputation to support downstream disease diagnosis tasks. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks.

In this work, a probabilistic entity embedding-based clustering framework is proposed to address these problems. This method encodes each PV system's characteristic power generation patterns and uncertainty as a probability distribution, then groups systems by their statistical distances and agglomerative clustering. Applied to a multi-year residential PV dataset, it produces concise, uncertainty-aware cluster profiles that outperform a physics-based baseline in representativeness and robustness, and support reliable missing-value imputation. A systematic hyperparameter study further offers practical guidance for balancing model performance and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $χ_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $χ_{\rm max} = 20-160$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its underlying structure. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The effectiveness of the MPS-based ansatz for capturing complex correlation structures in time-series data makes it a powerful foundation for tackling challenging time-series analysis problems across science, industry, and medicine.</p></details> | 31 pages, 14 figures |

To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

Failure to adequately address missing data can lead to biased estimates and consequently flawed conclusions. In this study, we present a novel imputation method that leverages significant annual components identified through the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) technique to improve the accuracy and integrity of imputed datasets. Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts. Our method not only impute missing data but also ensures that the imputed values align with underlying temporal patterns, thereby facilitating more accurate and reliable conclusions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at the International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence (IJIMAI)</p></details> |
| **[TSRM: A Lightweight Temporal Feature Encoding Architecture for Time Series Forecasting and Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18878v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a temporal feature encoding architecture called Time Series Representation Model (TSRM) for multivariate time series forecasting and imputation. The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core. The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/RobertLeppich/TSRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pets: General Pattern Assisted Architecture For Time Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14209v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis has found widespread applications in areas such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and healthcare. However, real-world sequential data often exhibit a superimposed state of various fluctuation patterns, including hourly, daily, and monthly frequencies. Traditional decomposition techniques struggle to effectively disentangle these multiple fluctuation patterns from the seasonal components, making time series analysis challenging. Surpassing the existing multi-period decoupling paradigms, this paper introduces a novel perspective based on energy distribution within the temporal-spectrum space. By adaptively quantifying observed sequences into continuous frequency band intervals, the proposed approach reconstructs fluctuation patterns across diverse periods without relying on domain-specific prior knowledge. Building upon this innovative strategy, we propose Pets, an enhanced architecture that is adaptable to arbitrary model structures. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these compound pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically. Pets achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVL-Lab/TGC-MTS.</p></details> | Accepted in BIBM2024 |
| **[Multiple Imputation of Hierarchical Nonlinear Time Series Data with an Application to School Enrollment Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01872v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>International comparisons of hierarchical time series data sets based on survey data, such as annual country-level estimates of school enrollment rates, can suffer from large amounts of missing data due to differing coverage of surveys across countries and across times. A popular approach to handling missing data in these settings is through multiple imputation, which can be especially effective when there is an auxiliary variable that is strongly predictive of and has a smaller amount of missing data than the variable of interest. However, standard methods for multiple imputation of hierarchical time series data can perform poorly when the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest have a nonlinear relationship. Performance can also suffer if the multiple imputations are used to estimate an analysis model that makes different assumptions about the data compared to the imputation model, leading to uncongeniality between analysis and imputation models. We propose a Bayesian method for multiple imputation of hierarchical nonlinear time series data that uses a sequential decomposition of the joint distribution and incorporates smoothing splines to account for nonlinear relationships between variables. We compare the proposed method with existing multiple imputation methods through a simulation study and an application to secondary school enrollment data. We find that the proposed method can lead to substantial performance increases for estimation of parameters in uncongenial analysis models and for prediction of individual missing values.</p></details> | 34 pages, 5 figures |

| **[ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation--the process of estimating missing values--has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data preparation. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time Series Multitask Framework Integrating a Large Language Model, Pre-Trained Time Series Model, and Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07682v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, transportation, and industry. However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features, limiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a novel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal features with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive capabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model (LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few trainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time series data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge graphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds prompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed by a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning stage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated into the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust and versatile solution for time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor PCA for Factor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12981v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern empirical analysis often relies on high-dimensional panel datasets with non-negligible cross-sectional and time-series correlations. Factor models are natural for capturing such dependencies. A tensor factor model describes the $d$-dimensional panel as a sum of a reduced rank component and an idiosyncratic noise, generalizing traditional factor models for two-dimensional panels. We consider a tensor factor model corresponding to the notion of a reduced multilinear rank of a tensor. We show that for a strong factor model, a simple tensor principal component analysis algorithm is optimal for estimating factors and loadings. When the factors are weak, the convergence rate of simple TPCA can be improved with alternating least-squares iterations. We also provide inferential results for factors and loadings and propose the first test to select the number of factors. The new tools are applied to the problem of imputing missing values in a multidimensional panel of firm characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUSE-Net: Missingness-aware mUlti-branching Self-attention Encoder for Irregular Longitudinal Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00840v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The era of big data has made vast amounts of clinical data readily available, particularly in the form of electronic health records (EHRs), which provides unprecedented opportunities for developing data-driven diagnostic tools to enhance clinical decision making. However, the application of EHRs in data-driven modeling faces challenges such as irregularly spaced multi-variate time series, issues of incompleteness, and data imbalance. Realizing the full data potential of EHRs hinges on the development of advanced analytical models. In this paper, we propose a novel Missingness-aware mUlti-branching Self-Attention Encoder (MUSE-Net) to cope with the challenges in modeling longitudinal EHRs for data-driven disease prediction. The proposed MUSE-Net is composed by four novel modules including: (1) a multi-task Gaussian process (MGP) with missing value masks for data imputation; (2) a multi-branching architecture to address the data imbalance problem; (3) a time-aware self-attention encoder to account for the irregularly spaced time interval in longitudinal EHRs; (4) interpretable multi-head attention mechanism that provides insights into the importance of different time points in disease prediction, allowing clinicians to trace model decisions. We evaluate the proposed MUSE-Net using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our MUSE-Net outperforms existing methods that are widely used to investigate longitudinal signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[S4M: S4 for multivariate time series forecasting with Missing values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00900v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, the presence of block missing data introduces significant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and then perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in complex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and represent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two key components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our findings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series forecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research and deployment.

| **[TimesBERT: A BERT-Style Foundation Model for Time Series Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21245v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in diverse scenarios. Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Missing Data Imputation for Time Series Without Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05775v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge of handling missing data in time series is critical for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning (ML) models in applications like fifth generation mobile communication (5G) network management. Traditional methods for validating imputation rely on ground truth data, which is inherently unavailable. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing two statistical metrics, the wasserstein distance (WD) and jensen-shannon divergence (JSD), to evaluate imputation quality without requiring ground truth. These metrics assess the alignment between the distributions of imputed and original data, providing a robust method for evaluating imputation performance based on internal structure and data consistency. We apply and test these metrics across several imputation techniques. Results demonstrate that WD and JSD are effective metrics for assessing the quality of missing data imputation, particularly in scenarios where ground truth data is unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE ICC 2025 (International Conference on Communications).

| **[Bridging Smart Meter Gaps: A Benchmark of Statistical, Machine Learning and Time Series Foundation Models for Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07276v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integrity of time series data in smart grids is often compromised by missing values due to sensor failures, transmission errors, or disruptions. Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases. However, the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains remains a critical consideration.</p></details> |  |
